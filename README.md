## What I Attempted to Build
I began by deciding to work with React Native.  I wanted to make something that used BlueTooth and/or the camera, but neither of these functionalities are very accessible in React Native.  Instead, I resorted to just experimenting with some of the components of React Native.  In the end, I created an application that, through API calls, creates a random pokemon team, which can be "rerolled."

## Who Did What
I worked alone.

## What You Learned
* Firstly, I began with no knowledge of how to work with React Native, and ended with some semblance of an idea, though still rather rudimentary.
* Secondly, I had not done much work in JavaScript, and I learned about storing information in state, as well as a few other small pieces of JavaScript.
* Finally, I got a bit better at interacting with JSON objects, primarily through a somewhat better understanding of their structure.

## What Didn't Work
* As I said above, after some research I was pretty disappointed with React Native's capacity to use things like BlueTooth, the Camera, or I would expect other issues.
* While I generally felt like I had a pretty good handle on element styling, there were a few things that I wanted to do, such as add another element above the scrollview, that just wouldn't work the way I intended them to.# hack-a-thing1
